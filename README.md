# Rently - Decentralized Rent Payment Platform

Rently is a decentralized platform designed to streamline and secure rent payment and contract management. It allows landlords to set rent amounts, due dates, and penalties while enabling tenants to pay rent through Ethereum smart contracts. The platform ensures transparency, timely payments, and fair contract enforcement without intermediaries.

## Features
- Set rent details, including amount, due dates, and penalties.
- Secure and automated rent payment processing via blockchain.
- Transparency and immutability using Ethereum smart contracts.
- Real-time tracking of rent payments and penalties.
- Decentralized contract management with no reliance on intermediaries.

## Contract Details
- *Contract Address*: 0x90636728aF63da90e46a531579E902C19F4E2B02
- *Network*: Ethereum Testnet (Mantle Sepolia)

## Deployment
