# Rently - Decentralized Rent Payment Platform

Rently is a decentralized platform designed to streamline and secure rent payment and contract management. It allows landlords to set rent amounts, due dates, and penalties while enabling tenants to pay rent through Ethereum smart contracts. The platform ensures transparency, timely payments, and fair contract enforcement without intermediaries.

## Features
- Set rent details, including amount, due dates, and penalties.
- Secure and automated rent payment processing via blockchain.
- Transparency and immutability using Ethereum smart contracts.
- Real-time tracking of rent payments and penalties.
- Decentralized contract management with no reliance on intermediaries.

## Contract Details
- *Contract Address*: 0x\<your_contract_address_here>
- *Network*: Ethereum Testnet (e.g., Sepolia or Mantle Sepolia)

## Deployment
- *Contract Address*: View on Explorer
- *Coin Used*: ETH (Sepolia Testnet ETH)

## How to Use
1. *Set Tenant Address*: Landlords can assign tenants by entering their address.
2. *Set Rent Details*: Landlords set the rent amount (in Ether), due date, and penalty (in Ether).
3. *Pay Rent*: Tenants can pay their rent directly through the blockchain.
4. *Check Rent Due*: Tenants and landlords can view current rent dues.

## Frontend
The frontend allows users to interact with the Rently smart contract via an easy-to-use interface. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it connects to the Ethereum blockchain using the ethers.js library.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Deploy the smart contract on a test network.
3. Configure the frontend to interact with the deployed contract.
4. Connect using MetaMask to start managing rent payments securely.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with IPFS for storing rent-related documents and contracts.
- Implement automated notifications for rent due dates and penalties.
- Support for multiple tenants and contract types.
- Multi-signature wallet integration for joint property ownership.
